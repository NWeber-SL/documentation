## Summary

This API aims at allowing access to each of your organizationâ€™s vulnerabilities and runtime information on them.

The main piece of security information in ShiftLeft is called a Vulnerability, it represents a potentially exploitable path in your code base, this API allows you to get said vulnerabilities for all of the versions of all the applications in your organization,

### Data
The various queries on this API will return Vulnerabilities which contain all the necessary data for you to take action on a code exploitable area.

### A Vulnerability

```json
       {
           "applicationId": "project1549413585aa",
           "vulnerability": {
               "firstDetected": "041718202019.28",
               "vulnerabilityId": "database-write/e0ec210246d63ea44e28c01ed6113a66",
               "category": "a1-injection",
               "title": "Unsanitized database write in `DataLoader.run`",
               "description": "Attacker-controlled data is used in a database query without any sanitation or encoding. This could be intended behavior and thus has a low score. Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. By injecting hostile data, an attacker may trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization which can result in data loss, corruption, or disclosure to unauthorized parties, loss of accountability, denial of access or even a complete host takeover.",
               "score": 1,
               "severity": "LOW_IMPACT",
               "securityEvents": "1",
               "blockedEvents": "1",
               "calls	": "1",
               "locationURL": "/account/{accountId}/addInterest",
               "locationMethod": "addInterest",
               "status": "FIXED",
               "assignedTo": "example@shiftleft.io",
           }
       },
```


* `applicationId`: A unique identification string per application within your organization
* `vulnerability`:
	* 	`firstDetected`: A unix timestamp for the date and time when our analysis first detected this vulnerability.
	*  `vulnerabilityId`: A unique id for this particular vulnerability, it is unique accross all organizations.
	*  `category`: OWASP category of the vulnerability
	*  `title`: a friendly title for this vulnerability
	*  `description`: a more complete description of this vulnerability.
	*  `score`: a float score from 1-9 representing the OWASP severity of this vulnerability
	*  `severity`: one of `LOW_IMPACT`, `MEDIUM_IMPACT`, `HIGH_IMPACT` which are the levels ShiftLeft assigns according to score.
	*  `securityEvents`: count of security relevant events for the vulnerable endpoint
	*  `blockedEvents`: count of security relevant events that were blocked
	*  `calls`: total calls on the vulnerable endpoint. This represents regular traffic as well as any detected attacks
	*  `locationURL`: where the affected endpoint is published.
	*  `locationMethod`: starting method of the vulnerable code path
	*  `status`: UI configurable status of the vulnerability (Assignees, fixed or ignore state, etc)
	*  `assignedTo`: Person (email) assigned to fix or triage this vulnerability
	
A vulnerability is found on an Application through analysis and can be in various versions of the same Application, our API will allow you to slice the applications of your organization in various dimansions to obtain the data you need:

### Pagination

Our endpoints are always paginated, given the amount of results possibles for any query we offer our results in pages of 50 at a time with pagination information along each response, additionally we clasify results in 3 groups according to severity:

```json
{
	"page": "1",
 	"totalResults": "155",
  	"results": [],
  	"lowImpactResults": "104",
	"mediumImpactResults": "21",
	"highImpactResults": "30"
}
```

### Organization vulnerabilities

The outmost endoints allows querying/filtering for vulnerabilities at an organization level:

POST `/api/v3/public/orgs/{organization id}/vulnerabilities/`

This will result on a default query returning vulnerabilities with the following criteria:

* Belonging to the latest analyzed version of any app.
* Of any Severity
* Of any category
* With Any Description
* With or without calls
* With or without blocked calls.
* Arbitrarily sorted
* Only the first page (50 results)

To obtain an arbitrary page 

POST `/api/v3/public/orgs/{organization id}/vulnerabilities/page/{page number}`

if the page is outside of the possible range you will obtain an empty result set.

#### Filtering

The filtering criteria can be passed in the body of the query:

```json
{
        "orderByDirection": "DESC",
        "applicationId": [
            "project1549413585aa"
        ],
        "statusFilter": [
            "FIXED", "ASSIGNED"
        ],
        "severityFilter": [],
        "titleFilter": "",
        "assignedToFilter": [],
        "includeCalls": true
    }
},
```

* `orderByDirection`: either `DESC` or `ASC` will be applied to the `firstDetected` field of a vulnerability.
* `applicationId`: if included in this list, only results for these application IDs will be returned.
* `statusFilter`: if present, only results for vulnerabilities in these statuses will be returned
* `severityFilter`: if present, only results for vulnerabilities of these severities will be returned
* `titleFilter`: if present the vulnerability title will be partially-matched with this, it might make the query slower.
* `assignedToFilter`: if present, only vulnerabilities that have been assigned to the passed emails will be returned.
* `includeCalls`: true by default, this indicates that `securityEvents`, `blockedEvents` and `calls` will be returned as part of the results, omitting them might be beneficial if you do not need them as they slow a bit the query.

## Application vulnerabilities

Application level vulnerabilities is an endpoint that allows you to perform the exact same kind of query than for Organizations but it limits results displayed to one Application.

POST `/api/v3/public/orgs/{organization id}/application/{application id}/vulnerabilities/`

This will result on a default query returning vulnerabilities with the following criteria:

* Belonging to the latest analyzed version this app.
* Of any Severity
* Of any category
* With Any Description
* With or without calls
* With or without blocked calls.
* Arbitrarily sorted
* Only the first page (50 results)

To obtain an arbitrary page 

POST `/api/v3/public/orgs/{organization id}/application/{application id}/vulnerabilities/page/{page number}`

To obtain an arbitrary version (also supports `/page/{page number}` at the end)

POST `/api/v3/public/orgs/{organization id}/application/{application id}/version/{version}/vulnerabilities`

if the page is outside of the possible range you will obtain an empty result set.

#### Filtering

The filtering criteria can be passed in the body of the query:

```json
{
        "orderByDirection": "DESC",
        "statusFilter": [
            "FIXED", "ASSIGNED"
        ],
        "severityFilter": [],
        "titleFilter": "",
        "assignedToFilter": [],
        "includeTraffic": true
    }
},
```

* `orderByDirection`: either `DESC` or `ASC` will be applied to the `firstDetected` field of a vulnerability.
* `applicationId`: if included in this list, only results for these application IDs will be returned.
* `statusFilter`: if present, only results for vulnerabilities in these statuses will be returned
* `severityFilter`: if present, only results for vulnerabilities of these severities will be returned
* `titleFilter`: if present the vulnerability title will be partially-matched with this, it might make the query slower.
* `assignedToFilter`: if present, only vulnerabilities that have been assigned to the passed emails will be returned.
* `includeCalls`: true by default, this indicates that `securityEvents`, `blockedEvents` and `calls` will be returned as part of the results, omitting them might be beneficial if you do not need them as they slow a bit the query.
